title: Week 11 COVID-19 Projects and Oppia
---

COVID-19 Open Efforts
----------------------
This week we had the opportunity to research open efforts for COVID-19. While doing my own research and hearing about my classmates’ research, I was able to see how the tech community has been able to contribute to the efforts of COVID-19 research. I was surprised to see so many new open source projects have started as a result to the pandemic. Many projects that were not originally created for the purpose of tracking or researching COVID-19 have now converted their own projects to be related to the virus. Many of the projects we saw were similar. For example, there were multiple tracking software for keeping count of COVID related cases. There were also a few hardware related efforts that were related to PCR and other biological reactions. During a crisis like this, it was great to see how the tech community is doing its parts to contribute to the research efforts. 

Working with Oppia
-------------------
This week we have also continued to work on our wireframes for Oppia. We were able to finalize a layout for the site, and we only have to make a few minor edits on the content of site. This coming week we hope to set up the Oppia environments on our own machines so we can start coding the site. In order to do this, we have a meeting with Sean, the Oppia director, and he will be helping us set up and explaining to us the details of Oppia’s codebase. Since many of Oppia’s users use mobile devices, we also created mobile mock-ups for the site. 

I am super happy that we were able to finalize our wireframes this week. I am a little nervous about finishing our work by the deadline. Hopefully, we will be able to quickly understand the codebase so we can start coding.  

Also, here is a sneak peek of our site.
