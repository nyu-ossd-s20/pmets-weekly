title: Week 2
---

For this week, Ben, Daniel, and myself have been working on creating a Firefox Browser Extension. In class on Monday, we were
able to learn the basics of building an extension. When we started the group work, I was a bit overwhelmed since I am not so
familiar with building extensions and with Github. However, whenever I seemed to run into a problem my group members were
extremely helpful, and we were able to quickly complete the tasks. We also were able to decide on an idea for our browser
extension. We plan on building an extension that will change the theme colors of the NYU website. Even though it is a very
simple extension, I believe that the process will allow us to collaborate and allow us to improve our teamwork skills. 

We have decided to meet during the week to complete the browser extension. Since we were able to work quickly and efficiently
as a team, I believe that we will be able to finish our project on time. I believe that one of the biggest challenges we faced
was communicating with one another effectively. However, I believe that by meeting in person we will be able to overcome this
challenge and complete the task at hand. 

From this assignment, I hope to gain a better understanding of all the components that make up an open source project. I think it will be interesting to understand the different licences available for projects and understanding the nuances of each one.
