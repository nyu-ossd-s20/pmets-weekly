Vicky Steves
------------
This week we had the opportunity of having Vicky Steeves come talk to us for the second time. I really enjoy having her come to our classes not only because her talks are extremely informative but also, I find her area of work to be fascinating. Before these talks, I never knew that librarians were also computer scientists. It has been extremely fascinating for me to learn about how tech is used to manage a library and its resources. During her talk, Ms. Steeves spoke about how a great deal of code is no longer available to us because it is outdated and cannot be run on our machines. She also spoke about how some code will not function the same way on different machines. This was an issue I was aware of, however, I did not realize the implications it would have. From this talk, I was able to broaden my understanding of computer science and also learn about areas studies I was unaware of.
