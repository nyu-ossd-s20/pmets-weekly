title: Week 6 Vicky Steeves Talk and A Deep Dive Into Project Evaluations
---

Vicky Steves
------------
This week we had the opportunity of having Vicky Steeves come talk to us for the second time. I really enjoy having her come to our classes not only because her talks are extremely informative but also, I find her area of work to be fascinating. Before these talks, I never knew that librarians were also computer scientists. It has been extremely fascinating for me to learn about how tech is used to manage a library and its resources. During her talk, Ms. Steeves spoke about how a great deal of code is no longer available to us because it is outdated and cannot be run on our machines. She also spoke about how some code will not function the same way on different machines. This was an issue I was aware of, however, I did not realize the implications it would have. From this talk, I was able to broaden my understanding of computer science and also learn about areas studies I was unaware of. 

Project Evaluations
-------------------
This week we also started submitting our own project evaluations. I submitted one evaluation on Inkscape and another on TEAMMATES. From my evaluations, I was able to understand the different kinds of projects online and about the different kind of open source communities. It has been interesting to see the difference between very active communities and rather slow communities. I enjoyed doing my project evaluations and found the project evaluation template to extremely helpful. There were questions on the form, such as how many people have contributed in the past 6 months or how long does it take for a pull request to be accepted, to be very useful pieces of information. I think if I were to do my own evaluations I would not have taken these factors into consideration, but I feel as though many of those questions allowed me to gain a better understanding of the community I would have to work with in the future. 

What I Want to Contribute
