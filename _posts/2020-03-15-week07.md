title: Week 7 Starting Our Open Project
---

Overview of the Week
-------------------------------

This week has been a very busy week!!! On Monday, in lecture we went over the difference between merging and rebasing. Before the lecture, I didn’t know about rebasing, so the lecture was really informative. I think knowing about the difference between merging and rebasing will become even more important in the future when we start working on our own open source projects. On Wednesday, we were divided up into our groups and had the opportunity to discuss our future projects. 

First Group Meeting 
----------------------------

On Wednesday, I had my first group meeting with Karishma and Selam. During our first group meeting, we were able to decide a group meeting time, Mondays at 4:45 (after class). We were also able to pick a project, Oppia. On Oppia’s github [page](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia), they suggest that if you want to start a project, you can email them and they will provide more information on starting a project. Selam reached out to their team and within and we were in contact with a member of Oppia’s team, Sean. After our in-class meeting on Wednesday, Selam continued speaking with Sean and he suggested a few projects that we could start working on.
